# Level-Builder-and-Platformer
A game created using the pygame library that allows a player to build and play platforming levels as well as save and load those levels.
The game is fairly intuitive, however, here is an explanation for the mechanics regardless.
Upon launching the game, the player is greeted with a menu screen that provides three options: 
level selection, level creation, and quit. Press quit to quit the game. 
Level selection sends the user to a screen where they can pick from four levels to play, or return to the main menu. 
The player can click on any of these four levels to play that level. 
Alternatively, the user could choose to create a level from the main menu. 
In the level creation interface, there are two large buttons on the bar on the bottom of the screen. 
The leftmost one is the trash, and it removes a block from the user’s hand if one is there. 
The rightmost one is the play button, which allows the user to play the level that they designed. 
Between these buttons are five different blocks that the user can click to place those blocks on the level. 
After placing a block, it can be moved from its location by clicking on it and placing it in a different grid square. 
This does not provide an infinite supply of the moved block, as opposed to placing a block from the bottom of the screen. 
A menu screen can be accessed by pressing escape that allows the user to save or load a level, and subsequently 
select which level to load, or to return to the main menu. 
Once playing a level, the mechanics are simple. The ‘a’ and ‘d’ keys move the character left and right respectively, 
while the spacebar makes the character jump, and the escape key pauses the game and opens a small menu. 
There are five types of block that the player may interact with during the game; 
platforms in black, the goal in green, damaging blocks in red, bouncing blocks in blue, and falling blocks in grey. 
The player can die in two ways: falling off the screen, or taking damage three times, at which point the level resets
and the player can try again. The purpose of these levels is to either test a level you build, 
or learn the mechanics of the game, so punishing the player is counterproductive to the goal of this game.
